I really enjoyed this project. I learned how to use API using Axios. It allows you to fetch data from the API to see what posts were available, as well as let you POST new data/topic to the API

Roadblock: creating and log in user was quite complicated with the usage of API.

Future improvement: have a user authenticate process.
